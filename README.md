- 👋 Hi, I’m @fpinatti
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development since the ancient times of Macromedia Director, Flash, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and evolving more stuff related mainly to the "backend" stuff, like node.js, etc and keep updated with fresh fe trends.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help people lives, making a better world. Sounds too much? A little effort of each one of us can change the world.
- 📫 How to reach me: fpinatti@gmail.com
